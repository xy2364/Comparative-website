# **Spring bank Pharmaceuticals (competitive strength):  ** 
A clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using their proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid (SMNH) chemistry platform.    

SB 11285 will potentially be first IV STING agonist to enter the clinic – late 2018/early 2019.  

All of Spring Bank’s next generation STING agonists are specifically designed to be conjugated with antibodies as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for a possible targeted delivery approach. These compounds are potentially more potent than currently available STING modulators and have the potential to be administered intravenously.

# **Latest news about their STING Pathway: **   

*Advance the company’s proprietary, novel next-generation STING agonist candidate, SB 11285, into the clinic:   The company plans to submit a clinical trial application for SB 11285 in the second half of 2018, and, if approved, initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in hepatocellular carcinoma later in the second half of 2018.*
	
 *"We plan to focus on the development of our most advanced product candidate, inarigivir, for the treatment of hepatitis B virus and SB 11285, an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STING pathway."*
 
*Expand the Spring Bank STING agonist platform:  The company is exploring additional delivery methods for its STING agonist platform, including nanoparticle formulations as well as further development of antibody-drug conjugates to be used with the company’s STING agonist product candidates.*

**2017 Accomplishment of Advanced SB 11285 for immuno-oncology:  **  
• The company presented data from multiple preclinical studies that demonstrated SB 11285 as a highly potent anti-tumor agent with a durable anti-tumor response when administered by multiple routes in several tumor models.       
• Spring Bank initiated the IND-enabling toxicology program for SB 11285.    
• Spring Bank consummated an Evaluation Assessment Agreement with a major Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC)   biopharmaceutical company to examine the potential to conjugate the Spring Bank STING agonist compounds with proprietary antibodies for oncology.    
• Four Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications were published in January 2018 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the Spring Bank STING agonist platform program.
