# **Sirenas Corporate Profile (competitive strength):  **    
The company’s proprietary drug discovery technology, **`ATLANTIS™`**, uses **data mining** and **machine learning** approaches (BIG DATA) to uncover the therapeutic potential of nature’s chemistry from a diversity of global microbiome collections. Initially, Sirenas has deployed this technology in marine environments to sustainably collect samples of microorganisms and their affiliated commensal microbial communities, providing a rich source of valuable chemical diversity. Through these efforts, Sirenas has amassed a highly curated collection of hundreds of thousands of nature-inspired molecules that can be interrogated for their therapeutic potential.

ATLANTIS™ enables the uncovering of therapeutic leads from a previously hidden, rich pool of privileged chemistry that can be leveraged to help tackle the greatest unmet disease needs such as infectious diseases and oncology.

In addition, Sirenas is actively seeking partnership opportunities with pharmaceutical companies and research foundations to broaden use of its ATLANTIS™ technology. In February 2018, Sirenas and `Bristol-Meyers Squibb` entered into a multi-target collaboration to deploy ATLANTIS™ against certain undisclosed challenging therapeutic targets to identify potential drug candidates.
