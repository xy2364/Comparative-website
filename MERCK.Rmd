# **Merck & Co. (competitive strength):  **  
With Merck's `KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab)` and a growing early pipeline of 20 novel mechanisms, Merck has become a leader in immuno-oncology research with the largest clinical program in the industry. Data from Merck’s broad portfolio including KEYTRUDA, internally-discovered investigational STING agonist (MK-1454), and several collaborations including with *AstraZeneca* for the PARP inhibitor LYNPARZA® (olaparib), will be featured in more than 20 oral plenary and poster presentations.
