# **Synlogic Corporate Profile (competitive strength):  **  

Synlogic™ is pioneering the development of a **novel class of living Synthetic Biotic™ medicines based on its proprietary drug discovery and development platform**. Synlogic’s initial pipeline includes Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of rare genetic diseases, such as **Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD)** and **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**. In addition, the company is leveraging the broad potential of its platform to create Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of **other diseases**, such as liver disease, inflammatory and immune disorders, and cancer. Synlogic is collaborating with `AbbVie` to develop Synthetic Biotic-based treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

From their lastest posted data on STING, the data demonstrate the ability of Synthetic Biotic medicines to dramatically modulate the tumor microenvironment, generating potent and efficacious anti-tumor immunity.



# **Latest news about their STING Program: **  
June 25, 2018 -   
    *Synlogic Presents New Preclinical Data from Synthetic Biotic™ Immuno-Oncology Program at FOCIS 2018*     
    In a presentation at FOCIS: A Synthetic Biology Approach for the Treatment of Cancer and Inflammation, Synlogic described the engineering of Synthetic Biotic strains to execute a range of functions that are potentially useful for the treatment of cancer, including - immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-15, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, and production of small molecules, such as STING agonists, that are able to trigger robust anti-tumor immune responses as single agents.
    In a second presentation, *Using Synthetic Biotic Medicines to Activate Innate and Adaptive Immunity and Drive Antitumor Immune Responses*, data were presented from mouse tumor model studies of two genetic circuits engineered into E. coli Nissle to generate two bacterial strains, an immune “initiator” STING activating circuit (SYN-STING) and an immune “sustainer” kynurenine consuming circuit (SYN-Kyn).
