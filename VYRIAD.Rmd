# **Vyriad (potential competitive strength):  **    
A new Biotech startup. August 2016, Vyriad signed a licensing agreement with Florida-based StingInn, LLC to use that company’s cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) oncolytic virus technology with Vyriad’s oncolytic virotherapy product candidates for the treatment of advanced-stage cancers.     

The company began as `Omnis Pharma`, but last year it merged with `Magnis Therapeutics` to form Vyriad. The two companies combined their pipelines to include Phase II product candidates in ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma, and Phase I programs in glioblastoma, mesothelioma, head and neck cancer, blood cancers, endometrial cancer, hematologic malignancies, and gastrointestinal cancer.    

Vyriad also has seven pre-IND programs that include the pairing of oncolytic vaccines with other cancer immunotherapy approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors and standard chemotherapy treatments.   

# **Latest news on their collaboration with other big companies: (07/18/18)**       
They announced a collaboration agreement with `Merck KGaA`, `Darmstadt`, `Germany`, and `Pfizer` to expand its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial program in solid tumors to include a combination study of its lead asset, Voyager-V1, with avelumab*, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody. But, Vyriad hasn’t disclosed whether the drug target is STING-relevant or not.
