# **Mavupharma(competitive strength):  **  
Mavupharma, a biotech startup, is developing novel orally bioavailable, non-nucleotide, conditional modulators of the STING pathway to treat cancer and infectious disease. But the company hasn’t disclosed whether the drug target is STING or another protein in the STING pathway.  



# **Latest news about their STING Program: **  
Nov 29, 2017-   
    • Frazier-backed Mavupharma secures \$20M in Series A financing to fund STING program - *"Mavupharma (Mavu) announced today that it has secured \$20 million in a Series A financing led by `Frazier Healthcare` Partners and joined by `Alpine BioVentures`. Mavu is developing orally bioavailable, non-nucleotide modulators of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway to treat cancer and infectious diseases, and the Series A funding will be used primarily to advance Mavu's lead drug candidates into the clinic."*   
    *"Mavu's novel approach uses non-nucleotide small molecules to indirectly and conditionally modulate the pathway, and we are leveraging this technology to develop orally bioavailable STING activators with first-in-class potential."*
